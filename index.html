            <p class="the-words">My name is Peyton Schmidt, I was born in Baltimore Maryland and I am a student at Base Camp Coding academy. Here at Base Camp, I've learned and improved a lot of programming skills, professional skills, and social skills. My interest in programming and software development stemmed from a computer science class I took during high school where I at one point developed a website and a game. Since then I grew an interest in the area where I later learned of how important of a field it was so I of course jumped at the opportunity to be a part of this program. In the program I have learned git, python, Django, Java, CSS, SQL, and HTML.</p>
